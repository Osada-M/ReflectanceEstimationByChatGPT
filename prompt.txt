You are an expert in material properties. Your task is to determine the infrared reflectance of a given object. 
Please provide a single, reasonable value from the estimated range of infrared reflectance for each object. If your prediction is not conclusive, please output an approximate value as a guess. Note that the reflectivity of plastic bottles varies depending on their contents and labels. The greater the divergence of the refractive indices, the stronger the reflection.

Here are some example objects and their reflectance for reference:

dressing bottles [plastic, orange] : 0.326
dressing bottles [plastic, brown] : 0.327
dressing bottles [plastic, grean] : 0.399
dressing bottles [plastic, yellow] : 0.403
energy drink [aluminum can, blue] : 0.381
energy drink [aluminum can, pink] : 0.411
energy drink [aluminum can, yellow] : 0.424
energy drink [aluminum can, orange] : 0.428
chipstar [cardboard, green] : 0.470
chipstar [cardboard, red] : 0.470
chipstar [cardboard, orange] : 0.499
chipstar [cardboard, white] : 0.600
labeled plastic bottle [plastic, white] : 0.479
labeled plastic bottle [plastic, pink] : 0.547
labeled plastic bottle [plastic, orange] : 0.595
labeled plastic bottle [plastic, yellow] : 0.616
Qoo jelly [plastic, purple] : 0.546
Qoo jelly [plastic, pink] : 0.584
Qoo jelly [plastic, green] : 0.588
Qoo jelly [plastic, red] : 0.595
pringles tube [cardboard, green] : 0.662
pringles tube [cardboard, blue] : 0.687
pringles tube [cardboard, red] : 0.691
pringles tube [cardboard, yellow] : 0.696
yogurt [plastic, green] : 0.738
yogurt [plastic, red] : 0.743
yogurt [plastic, pink] : 0.754
yogurt [plastic, purple] : 0.763
tissue box [cardboard, blue] : 0.830
tissue box [cardboard, orange] : 0.860
tissue box [cardboard, green] : 0.909
tissue box [cardboard, pink] : 0.960
paper box [cardboard, orange] : 0.792
paper box [cardboard, yellow] : 0.903
paper box [cardboard, blue] : 0.964
paper box [cardboard, red] : 0.965
pocky [cardborad, green] : 0.495
pocky [cardborad, blue] : 0.625
pocky [cardborad, red] : 0.850
pocky [cardborad, yellow] : 0.944

|Reason|Aluminum is a metal, but its surface is printed with resin ink, which reflects light less than cardboard or mirrors. Since the reflectance of a Pringles tube (Aru Gami) is 0.684, the reflectance of an energy drink (aluminum can) is estimated to be 0.422.|
|**Response**|range: 0.41 - 0.46, prediction: **0.422**|

|Name|yogort|
|Reason|Yogurt is a food product, but this is usually packaged in a plastic container. The yogurt container is considered less reflective than a similarly labeled plastic bottle. So, the reflectance of yogurt is greater than 0.616. On the other hand, it is white in color and will reflect relatively well. Therefore, we can expect it to be 0.75.|
|**Response**|range: 0.68 - 0.79, prediction: **0.762**|
