|Name|whiteboard eraser|
|Reason|A whiteboard eraser typically has a plastic body and a felt pad. The plastic could have a similar reflectance to that of labeled plastic bottles, but the felt pad, being a soft and non-glossy material, would reflect less. Given the reflectance values for labeled plastic bottles range from 0.479 to 0.616, and considering the felt's lower reflectance, a reasonable estimate for a whiteboard eraser could be slightly lower.|

|Name|bristle of a brush|
|Reason|The bristles of a brush, depending on their material (synthetic or natural), will have a reflectance somewhat akin to that of fabric or less reflective plastics. Given that they are not designed to be reflective and have a matte surface, their reflectance would be lower than that of glossy or semi-transparent plastics.|

|Name|smartphone|
|Reason|The reflectance of a smartphone would vary significantly based on its surface material. A smartphone with a glass front and a metallic back could have higher reflectance due to the glass and metal surfaces. Considering the reflectance of aluminum cans as a reference, and knowing that glass can reflect similarly or more depending on the treatment, an average smartphone could have a moderately high reflectance.|

|Name|adhesive|
|Reason|Adhesive materials, depending on their type (liquid, gel, or tape), have varying surface characteristics. Most adhesives are designed to be applied thinly and hence would not significantly contribute to the reflectance. However, if we consider the packaging, it would typically be similar to labeled plastic bottles but with less surface area being reflective.|

|Name|insect repellent|
|Reason|Insect repellent containers are often made of plastic and might have labels covering much of their surface. Their reflectance could be similar to labeled plastic bottles, but potentially lower due to textural differences and less surface area being smooth and reflective.|

|Name|zone (can drink)|
|Reason|Assuming "zone" is a typo for a canned drink, similar to an "energy drink," its aluminum can with printed resin ink would have reflectance values close to those of energy drinks. The reflectance would slightly vary based on the color and design but generally remain within the same range.|
|**Response**|range: 0.41 - 0.46, prediction: **0.43**|

|Name|candy crackers|
|Reason|Candy crackers packaging, if made of cardboard like Chipstar or Pocky, would have a reflectance dependent on the color and surface finish. Given that cardboard packaging for snacks tends to have a high reflectance, especially if brightly colored or white, we can expect it to be similar to other high-reflectance cardboard packaging.|
